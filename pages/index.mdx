◕ ◡ ◕ っ Hi, I'm Rohan! I'm a {age} y/o student from Mumbai, India passionate about **Digital Design** and **Development**.

#### <mark>Present</mark>

Right now, I'm tinkering with impactful JavaScript tooling to enhance UX + DX. Currently exploring how compilation can augment JavaScript UI libraries through <Link href="/work/million-js"><strong>🦁 Million.js</strong></Link>.

In the summer of 2022, I'll be interning at [**▲ Vercel**](https://vercel.com/) to help work on projects in the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) ecosystem and learn more about the bleeding _edge_ of web development.

#### <mark>Previously</mark>

I won the **2nd place** grand award in Systems Software at the [2021 International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF)](https://www.societyforscience.org/press-release/2021-regeneron-isef-grand-awards/#:~:text=SOFT031%20%E2%80%94%20Lucia%3A%20Creating,States%20of%20America) with <Link href="/work/lucia-js"><strong>🙋‍♀️ Lucia.js</strong></Link> out of **1.8k+ students** around the world.

I pioneered [**🧠 KBowl**](https://kbowl.aidenybai.com) (virtual [Knowledge Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Bowl) events) during the COVID-19 lockdown. I helped organize the K-12 leagues for Washington State, consisting of **30+ schools, 40+ teachers and 1k+ students**, throughout 2020 and 2021.

I like blasting music with my windows down on the highway (_88rising ( ´Д`)ﾉ_), design, poetry, cycling, and binging boba popsicles. My favorite song is [_sunkissed_ · khai dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSkd4NC1kqY).
